[![Covid-19 and Shielders' Mental Health and Political Engagement Survey](/assets/images/shielding.png)](https://bathpsychology.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_dnUvoRjMe0LFtHM)

Help us, in conjunction with the University of Liverpool, the University of Bath, and the All-Party Political Group on Vulnerable Groups to Pandemics, to gain a better understanding of the effects of COVID-19 worry and stress factors on shielders' mental health and political engagement.

The information will help to compare the effects of COVID-19 stressors between the general population and who is currently shielding to raise awareness and develop policy interventions to improve the care that this group receives.

Please do [complete the survey](https://bathpsychology.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_dnUvoRjMe0LFtHM).
