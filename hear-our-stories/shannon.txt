<p>I'm Shannon Banks, and I've been shielding for the past two and a half years.</p>
<p>Before the pandemic, I was travelling around the world with my work. In 2019, I visited the US, Kenya, Brazil, China, much of Europe, and worked in all those places. I was living with my husband and my daughter running a successful business, had a lot of friends, and went out and saw people.</p>
<p>For nearly two years, I've been living in a flat on my own separate from my husband and my daughter, while I've been shielding, so that my daughter can attend school. My daughter is 16 years old now.</p>
<p>It's hard to describe what it feels like to shield for this long. It's really impossible to summarise the things that I miss. I've really watched my friends move on with their lives, and I feel really separate from them. And even my husband is working from home in order to protect me as much as he can. And so he and my daughter are also massively impacted.</p>
<p>The flat that I'm renting is across the street from our house. And so my husband makes dinner for us every evening, and I go there and eat at a distance in the garden with them so that I see them every day. But it's not the same as living in the house with them.</p>
<p>I'm immunocompromised because I have a disease called lupus and I'm not protected by the vaccine. The drugs that I'm on create immunosuppression. And the data says I'm at an extremely high risk from COVID.</p>
<p>I'm British but I'm originally from the United States and my family mostly are in the US. And I haven't seen my brother or my sisters in almost three years. And I really miss them. I'm not able to travel on public transport, or fly. And that means that not only can I not see them, I also have had to give up quite a lot of work. I've been lucky that I've converted a lot of my work to virtual. But I still get asked to do things that I'm unable to do. I miss spending time with my friends in their homes. I haven't been in anyone's home since the start of the pandemic. I miss eating in restaurants. I miss going to pubs, I miss going to the theatre. I miss getting my hair cut. I miss almost everything. I'm stuck in this place.</p>
<p>I think people underestimate the complexity of the illnesses that many of us have, that we live with anyway. And as a result of my lupus, I do spend quite a lot of time in doctors' offices and hospitals. And I think that's true for many of us in the immunocompromised community. COVID has just made this even more difficult, because every time we enter a hospital, we put ourselves at risk. I think from a mental health perspective, I feel like I've managed to stay reasonably resilient. But it's very hard, not being able to live a normal life, and also not knowing how it ends, and when we actually get out of this situation.</p>
<p>If I got Evusheld, I would immediately move back home and be back together with my husband and my daughter who's grown from 14 to 16 while I've been away from her. I really need Evusheld to get home again.</p>
