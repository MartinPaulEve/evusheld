## Summary
Evusheld is a preventative treatment for Covid-19. There are around 500k people who are still at increased risk from this deadly disease. The Government must protect them – Evusheld could help.

## Who are the Forgotten 500K? 
There are around 500,000 people in the UK who are immunocompromised or suppressed. This means they are often at higher risk from Covid-19. It also means that they are less likely to be protected by vaccines, because their immune systems are less able to protect against, and fight off, infection. 
As a result, many are still taking precautions, even continuing to shield in their homes. According to a survey by Blood Cancer UK, for example, 82% of people with blood cancer are still anxious about the threat of Covid. This forgotten community desperately wants to return to normal, be able to work safely, see their friends, and hug their loved ones. Evusheld could help them.

<summary><b><u>What is Evusheld?</u></b></summary>
<br>
Evusheld is a preventative (or prophylactic) treatment that protects from Covid-19 by preventing infection and reducing the chances of becoming seriously ill. It can help to protect people whose weakened immune systems haven’t responded well to the vaccines by giving them the antibodies they can’t produce themselves; for this reason, Evusheld is called a ‘monoclonal antibody treatment.’ It is made up of two monoclonal antibodies: tixagevimab and cilgavimab.

While other Covid treatments are already used in the NHS, the existing treatments help to reduce the chances of being hospitalised or dying and help to clear the virus out quickly. They’re called ‘post-exposure’ treatments, and are an important way to protect the immunocompromised <b>after</b> they’ve become infected.

If you’re immunocompromised and test positive for Covid, see [Blood Cancer UK’s advice](https://bloodcancer.org.uk/support-for-you/coronavirus-covid-19/covid-vaccine-blood-cancer/covid-antibody-treatment/) to understand what to do next, and how the process differs across the four nations. Its website is specific to people with blood cancer, but the information is useful for anyone who is [eligible](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-care-and-treatments-for-coronavirus/treatments-for-coronavirus/) for these treatments. Charities supporting patients with your condition may also have advice on their website.

Yet the system through which these Covid treatments are delivered hasn’t been reliable. Only around [17%](https://reports.opensafely.org/reports/antivirals-and-nmabs-for-non-hospitalised-covid-19-patients-coverage-report/#demographic:~:text=Table%201%20Count,up%20to%20100%25) of people who become infected with Covid and are referred for treatment, actually receive it. While many of those who didn’t receive treatment will not have needed it (because, for example, they didn’t have Covid symptoms), there are systemic issues in how these treatments are being delivered that mean that some people who need them just can’t access them. Relying, then, on treatments given only after becoming infected with Covid is a terrifying prospect for people who are at very high risk of hospitalisation, and death. 

Despite these treatments, many people with weakened immune systems are still at higher risk of poor outcomes and death from Covid. People with blood cancer, for example, are [12 times](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/preexistingconditionsofpeoplewhodiedduetocovid19englandandwales) more likely to die from Covid than the general population, according to an analysis of ONS data by Blood Cancer UK. In people with a kidney transplant, the relative risk increased from 7 times higher than the general population in the first wave of Covid in 2020, to [26 times higher](https://www.opensafely.org/research/2022/covid-mortality-changes-over-time/) in the third wave in 2021. An [analysis of intensive care data](https://www.icnarc.org/our-audit/audits/cmp/reports) shows that, while only 1 in 134 of the population is immunocompromised, 1 in 11 of all people admitted to the ICU for Covid were immunocompromised, in the first half of this year.

Further, the likelihood of receiving these treatments after being infected with Covid is related to [several factors](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.07.22272026v2.full.pdf) including whether they live in a deprived area, their ethnicity, and which region they live in. <b>To reduce their risk, the immunocompromised need a safe, effective treatment that aims to prevent them becoming infected in the first place.</b>

<summary><b><u>Why don’t we have Evusheld yet?</u></b></summary>
<br>
Evusheld has been rolled out in 33 countries, including the United States, Canada, Japan, and France. Most of these countries have measured the impact and effectiveness of Evusheld to monitor whether it works against new variants. The latest [real-world data](https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciac625/6651663), published as a pre-print (undergoing peer-review) on July 29 and collected in Israel during the Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 waves, shows that immunocompromised <b>people who took Evusheld were half as likely to become infected with Covid, and 92% less likely to be hospitalised and/or die.</b>

Although Evusheld was approved for use in the UK on 17 March 2022 by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the Government hasn’t bought any doses for use by the NHS. The Westminster Government’s rationale for this is that there isn’t enough evidence of Evusheld’s effectiveness against the Omicron subvariants. While the main clinical trials testing Evusheld were conducted against the Delta variant of the virus, newer research has shown that it’s still effective against Omicron BA.1 and BA.2, but less effective against Omicron BA.4 and BA.5. For more information on Evusheld’s effectiveness against the Omicron variants, see [this blog](https://bloodcancer.org.uk/news/evusheld-does-it-work-against-omicron/) post by Blood Cancer UK.

It’s impossible to say whether Evusheld will be more or less effective against future variants, because we can’t predict how the virus will mutate. This is the same for all monoclonal antibody treatments, including sotrovimab, which is used in the NHS to treat Covid after you’ve been infected. The Covid vaccines are even more susceptible to reduced effectiveness against new variants than Evusheld or sotrovimab, because they target a part of the virus that has mutated considerably over the course of the pandemic. However, the Government has rightly continued to purchase vaccines.

<b>We believe Evusheld should be bought by the Government, because it still has the ability to prevent Covid and can help to fight against the virus when someone comes into contact with it.</b> It’s needed for those people whose immune systems aren’t responding adequately to the vaccines. There are robust safeguards in place in the UK to ensure that drugs such as these are monitored for effectiveness in light of new variants – as is the case for sotrovimab. Evusheld should be bought, rolled out, and monitored accordingly when new variants arise.

<summary><b><u>What’s going on with Evusheld now?</u></b></summary>
<br>
In July, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) [launched an appraisal](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/indevelopment/gid-ta11102) of Evusheld. This is an evaluation of its clinical and cost-effectiveness. Covid vaccines and other Covid treatments are normally rolled out before they’re fully appraised by NICE, via a pathway called [RAPID C-19](https://www.nice.org.uk/covid-19/rapid-c19). This is because the individual and public health need for these treatments is considered greater and more urgent than the need to determine how cost-effective they are. If the vaccines had undergone NICE appraisals before they were rolled out, for instance, they would have been delayed, typically for around one year.

In August, the Government announced that, based on advice from the RAPID C-19 Oversight Group and independent experts, it would wait until Evusheld had been appraised by NICE before deciding whether to make it available. This is unusual for Covid treatments: it’s the first time this has happened since the start of the pandemic. The NICE appraisal won’t be complete until the end of May 2023. For immunocompromised people who haven’t mounted an adequate response to the Covid vaccines, this means they may have very little protection against Covid this winter, and must rely on post-exposure Covid treatments after they become infected.

The immunocompromised urgently need a safe and effective treatment to help prevent them from getting infected with Covid, and from the severe outcomes associated with the disease. <b>The Government should buy Evusheld and make it available on the NHS in time for winter, to help protect those who can’t rely on vaccines and post-exposure treatments alone.</b>
