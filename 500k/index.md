<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Evusheld is a preventative treatment for Covid-19. There are around 500k people who are still
    at increased risk from this deadly disease. The Government must protect them – Evusheld could
    help.</p>


<h2>Who are the Forgotten 500K?</h2>
<p>There are around 500,000 people in the UK who are immunocompromised or suppressed. This means
    they are often at higher risk from Covid-19. It also means that they are less likely to be
    protected by vaccines, because their immune systems are less able to protect against, and fight
    off, infection. <br>
    As a result, many are still taking precautions, even continuing to shield in their homes.
    According to a survey by Blood Cancer UK, for example, 82% of people with blood cancer are still
    anxious about the threat of Covid. This forgotten community desperately wants to return to
    normal, be able to work safely, see their friends, and hug their loved ones. Evusheld could help
    them. </p>

<h3>What is Evusheld?</h3>
<p>Evusheld is a preventative (or prophylactic) treatment that protects from Covid-19 by preventing infection and reducing the chances of becoming seriously ill. It can help to protect people whose weakened immune systems haven’t responded well to the vaccines by giving them the antibodies they can’t produce themselves; for this reason, Evusheld is called a ‘monoclonal antibody treatment.’ It is made up of two monoclonal antibodies: tixagevimab and cilgavimab.
<p>


<p>While other Covid treatments are already used in the NHS, the existing treatments help to reduce
    the chances of being hospitalised or dying and help to clear the virus out quickly. They’re
    called ‘post-exposure’ or antiviral treatments, and are an important way to protect the
    immunocompromised after they’ve become infected. But despite these treatments, many people with
    weakened immune systems are still at very high risk of poor outcomes and death from Covid.
    People with blood cancer, for example, are <a
        href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/preexistingconditionsofpeoplewhodiedduetocovid19englandandwales">12
        times</a> more likely to die from Covid than the
    general population, according to an analysis of ONS data by Blood Cancer UK. An <a
        href="https://www.icnarc.org/our-audit/audits/cmp/reports">analysis of
        intensive care data</a> shows that, while only 1 in 134 of the population is
    immunocompromised, 1 in
    11 of all people admitted to the ICU for Covid were immunocompromised, in the first half of this
    year.</p>

<p>Further, the likelihood of receiving these treatments after being infected with Covid is
    correlated with <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.07.22272026v2.full.pdf">several
        factors</a> including whether they live in a deprived area, their ethnicity, and
    which region they live in. To reduce their risk, the immunocompromised need a safe, effective
    treatment that aims to prevent them becoming infected in the first place

<h3>Why don’t we have Evusheld yet?</h3>


<p>Evusheld has been rolled out in 33 countries, including the United States, Canada, Japan, and
    France. Most of these countries have measured the impact and effectiveness of Evusheld to
    monitor
    whether it works against new variants. The latest <a
        href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciac625/6651663">real-world
        data</a>, published as a pre-print
    (undergoing peer-review) on July 29 and collected in Israel during the Omicron BA.1 and BA.2
    waves,
    shows that immunocompromised people who took Evusheld were half as likely to become infected
    with
    Covid, and 92% less likely to be hospitalised and/or die.</p>

<p>Although Evusheld was approved for use in the UK on 17 March 2022 by the Medicines and
    Healthcare
    Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the Government hasn’t procured it (meaning they haven’t
    bought
    any doses). They argue that there isn’t enough evidence of its effectiveness against the Omicron
    subvariants. While the main clinical trials testing Evusheld were conducted against the Delta
    variant of the virus, newer research has shown that it’s still effective against Omicron BA.1
    and
    BA.2, but less effective against Omicron BA.4 and BA.5. For more information on Evusheld’s
    effectiveness against the Omicron variants, see <a
        href="https://bloodcancer.org.uk/news/evusheld-does-it-work-against-omicron/">this blog
        post</a>
    by Blood Cancer UK.</p>

<p>It’s impossible to say whether Evusheld will be more or less effective against future
    variants,
    because we can’t predict how the virus will mutate. This is the same for all monoclonal
    antibody
    treatments, including sotrovimab, which is used in the NHS to treat Covid after you’ve been
    infected. This is also the same for the Covid vaccines, which target a part of the virus
    that has
    mutated considerably over the course of the pandemic.</p>

<p>We believe Evusheld should be bought by the Government regardless, because it still has
    the
    ability
    to prevent Covid and destroy the virus when someone comes into contact with it. It’s needed
    for
    those people whose immune systems aren’t responding adequately to the vaccines. There are
    robust
    safeguards in place in the UK to ensure that drugs such as these are monitored for
    effectiveness in
    light of new variants – as is the case for sotrovimab. Evusheld should be bought, rolled
    out, and
    monitored accordingly when new variants arise.</p>


<h3>What’s going on with Evusheld now?</h3>


<p> In July, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) <a
        href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/indevelopment/gid-ta11102">launched an appraisal</a>
    of
    Evusheld. This is an evaluation of its clinical and cost-effectiveness. Covid vaccines and other
    Covid treatments are normally rolled out before they’re fully appraised by NICE, via a pathway
    called <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/covid-19/rapid-c19">RAPID C-19</a>. This is because the
    individual and public health need for these treatments is
    considered greater and more urgent than the need to determine how cost-effective they are. If
    the
    vaccines had undergone NICE appraisals before they were rolled out, for instance, they would
    have
    been delayed, typically for around one year.
</p>
<p>In August, the Government announced that it would wait until Evusheld had been appraised by NICE
    before deciding whether to make it available. This is unusual for Covid treatments: it’s the
    first
    time this has happened since the start of the pandemic. The NICE appraisal won’t be complete
    until
    the end of May 2023. For immunocompromised people who haven’t mounted an adequate response to
    the
    Covid vaccines, this means they have very little protection against Covid this winter, and must
    rely
    on post-exposure Covid treatments after they become infected. Considering that only <a
        href="https://reports.opensafely.org/reports/antivirals-and-nmabs-for-non-hospitalised-covid-19-patients-coverage-report/#demographic:~:text=Table%201%20Count,up%20to%20100%25">17.6%</a>
    of people
    who become infected with Covid and are referred for treatment actually receive it, this is a
    terrifying prospect for people who are at very high risk of hospitalisation, and death.
    The immunocompromised urgently need a safe and effective treatment to help prevent them from
    getting
    infected with Covid, and from the severe outcomes associated with the disease. The Government
    should
    buy Evusheld and make it available on the NHS in time for winter, to help protect those who
    can’t
    rely on vaccines and post-exposure treatments alone.</p>
