<summary><b><u>Who are the Forgotten 500K?</u></b></summary>
<br>
<p>There are at least 500,000 people in the UK who are immunocompromised. This means they are often at higher risk from Covid-19. It also means that they are less likely to be well-protected by vaccines, because their immune systems are less able to protect against, and fight off, infection. </p>

<p>As a result, many are still taking precautions, even continuing to shield in their homes. According to a survey by Blood Cancer UK, for example, 82% of people with blood cancer are still anxious about the threat of Covid. A survey conducted by Immunodeficiency UK showed that 28% of people affected by primary immunodeficiency were not going out at all, while 44% reported little confidence in leaving their homes due to the threat of becoming infected. This forgotten community desperately wants to return to normal, be able to work safely, see their friends, and hug their loved ones.<b> Evusheld could help them. </b> </p>
