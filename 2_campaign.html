            <h2 id="join-the-group">Join the Group</h2>
<p>Our primary gathering place is on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/692949675108155/">Forgotten Lives UK Facebook Group</a>. If you are on Facebook, do please join us there. We also have <a href="https://twitter.com/evusheld4theuk">a Twitter feed</a> with up-to-date information.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-the-group-do">What Does the Group Do?</h2>
<p>Approximately 1.2m people in the United Kingdom have conditions that render them more vulnerable to Covid. Our group advocates for their ongoing protection through prophylaxis and other preventative measures.</p>

<p>We cover all vulnerable people who are less likely to have mounted a response to vaccination against Covid-19, as listed in, but not exclusive to, the NHS England RAPID-C19 report ‘<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/higher-risk-patients-eligible-for-covid-19-treatments-independent-advisory-group-report/defining-the-highest-risk-clinical-subgroups-upon-community-infection-with-sars-cov-2-when-considering-the-use-of-neutralising-monoclonal-antibodies">Defining the Highest-Risk Clinical Subgroups upon Community Infection with SARS-CoV-2 When Considering the Use of Neutralising Monoclonal Antibodies (NMABs) and Antiviral Drugs: Independent Advisory Group Report</a>’.</p>

<h2 id="who-designed-your-logo-and-site">Who Designed Your Logo and Site?</h2>
<p>Amanda Dantuma, of <a href="https://www.dantumadesign.com/">Dantuma Design</a>, designed our logo and brand. We are very grateful to her for her work. Please check out her site.</p>

<p>The “Forgotten 500K Campaign” was designed and supported by <a href="https://theandpartnership.com/gb/">The&amp;Partnership</a> and <a href="https://www.msixandpartners.com/">mSix&amp;Partners</a>.</p>

<h2 id="who-do-we-work-with">Who Do We Work With?</h2>
<p>To achieve our goal we need to enlist support from across the political spectrum. We need support from people in media, in health, and in any other avenue that will benefit us. Anybody with influence can help our campaign.</p>

<p>It is vital, therefore, that the group remains apolitical and maintains a professional outlook in our communications and image. While many members will be frustrated at two years of isolation and may feel let down, we must work across political divides to seek allies wherever they may be. Hence, we want to keep political discussion off the group page. Further, we expect civility, politeness, and respect from all members of the group.</p>

<h2 id="who-funds-this-and-who-are-you">Who Funds This and Who Are You?</h2>
<p>We receive no funding from anyone. We are not affiliated with AstraZeneca or any other pharmaceutical company. The campaign is coordinated by three volunteers - Nikola Brigden, Martin Paul Eve, and Mark Oakley - who receive no remuneration for our work, operating strictly on a voluntary basis as patients and carers.</p>

<p>For more information about who we are, what we do, and with whom we work, please contact <a href="mailto:martin@eve.gd">Martin Eve</a>.</p>

<h1 id="what-can-i-do">What Can I Do?</h1>
<h2 id="write-to-your-mp-and-members-of-the-house-of-lords">Write to Your MP and Members of the House of Lords</h2>
<p>One of the most important actions that you can take is to <a href="https://www.writetothem.com/write">write to your MP</a>.</p>

<p>To make this effective, we have created a set of template letters that you can send to your MPs. Importantly, you should change this letter. Boilerplate letters tend to get standard responses, whereas a personally crafted letter will make much more of a difference:</p>

<h3 id="patient-letters">Patient Letters</h3>
<p>These are for people who are, themselves, shielding. The letters are variations on a theme and you can choose which to use.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/assets/downloads/August-MP-Letter-1.docx">Letter 1</a></li>
  <li><a href="/assets/downloads/August-MP-Letter-3.docx">Letter 2</a></li>
  <li><a href="/assets/downloads/August-MP-Letter-4.docx">Letter 3</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="friends-and-family-letter">Friends and Family Letter</h3>
<p>This letter is for people who are friends or family members of immunocompromised people.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/assets/downloads/August-MP-Letter-2.docx">Letter for Friends or Family</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="follow-up-rebuttal-letter">Follow-up Rebuttal Letter</h3>
<p>This letter is a follow-up letter addressing the most common templated replies that we have seen from MPs. Obviously, please use whichever points apply to the response you have received. The first point, highlighting the criticisms from senior members of the Conservative Party, only apply if you have a Conservative MP.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/assets/downloads/2022-09-18-Response.docx">Rebuttal points</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="make-media-contact">Make Media Contact</h2>
<p>We need to generate as much attention as possible for this issue. If you have contacts in the media, or work in the media yourself, please <a href="mailto:martin@eve.gd">get in touch with us</a>.</p>

<h2 id="legal-advice">Legal Advice</h2>
<p>If you are a lawyer with any background in disability discrimination, we would love to <a href="mailto:martin@eve.gd">hear from you</a>.</p>

<h2 id="share-information">Share Information</h2>
<p>Please share new studies or news items with the group. If you don’t use Facebook, please email them to <a href="mailto:martin@eve.gd">Martin Eve</a>.</p>
