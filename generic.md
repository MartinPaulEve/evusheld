## Join the Group
Our primary gathering place is on the [Evusheld for the UK Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/692949675108155/). If you are on Facebook, do please join us there. This group exists for one purpose: to get this drug introduced in the UK with access for all those who need it.

AstraZeneca’s Evusheld is a preventative (“prophylactic”) treatment for Covid, approved for UK use on the 17th March 2022. However, there has been no progress since then on the drug’s accessibility on the NHS or privately. This has prolonged the shielding imposed on so many of us across the UK. 

To achieve our goal we need to enlist support from across the political spectrum. We need support from people in media, in health, and in any other avenue that will benefit us. Anybody with influence can help our campaign.

It is vital, therefore, that the group remains a-political and maintains a professional outlook in our communications and image. While many members will be frustrated at two years of isolation and may feel let down, we must work across political divides to seek allies wherever they may be. Hence, we want to keep political discussion off the group page. Further, we expect civility, politeness, and respect from all members of the group.

## Write to Your MP and Members of the House of Lords
One of the most important actions that you can take is to [write to your MP](https://www.writetothem.com/write).

To make this effective, we have created [a template letter](/assets/downloads/Template-Letter-for-MPs.docx) that you can use to write effectively. Importanly, you should change this letter. Boilerplate letters tend to get standard responses, whereas a personally crafted letter will make much more of a difference.

## Make Media Contact
We need to generate as much attention as possible for this issue. If you have contacts in the media, or work in the media yourself, please [get in touch with us](mailto:martin@eve.gd).

## Legal Advice
If you are a lawyer with any background in disability discrimination, we would love to [hear from you](mailto:martin@eve.gd). 

## Sign the Petition
Please [sign this petition](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/611884). This is not as effective as writing to your MP, but it may still help.

## Share Information
Please share new studies or news items with the group. If you don't use Facebook, please email them to [Martin Eve](mailto:martin@eve.gd).
