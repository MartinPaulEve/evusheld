Evusheld could mean freedom for the 500,000 people still shielding in the UK. But only if the UK government procures it. This page details the testimony of overseas patients who have received Evusheld and have, as a result, got their lives back.

<h2>Steve, the US heart transplant recipient</h2>
<p><span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/Steve.png %}" alt="Steve" /></span>In my early 60s I had been quite frightened even to go to doctors appointments. Then I received Evusheld. The statistical benefit of this product and the encouragement of knowledgeable physicians in the US gave me the confidence to feel that it was much less likely for me to be seriously ill or worse if I happened to get infected. That was crucial to me. Since I received Evusheld, it has been recommended by many more physicians with at least one calling it a 'game changer' for the immunocompromised.</p>

<h2>Susan, US with graft-versus-host disease</h2>
<p><span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/Susan.png %}" alt="Susan" /></span>Similar to others, I was quite nervous about going out under any circumstances... complicated by the fact that I only received two doses of Pfizer due to a GVHD flare after the second. With all the positive stats and info from physicians, I now feel much more comfortable attending doctors appointments, PT, occasional shopping (with masks) etc. It has significantly changed by concerns about getting COVID-19 and the dire outcomes that could occur prior to Evusheld.</p>

<h2>Marjorie, US supporter of family member with kidney transplant</h2>
<p>My husband had a kidney transplant and had no antibodies after three vaccines and two booster shots. Evusheld has given us the opportunity to go places masked and has allowed us to have some semblance of a life. His doctor has encouraged us to be safe yet feels confident that the Evusheld has given him enough protection that, should be contract Covid, he can be successfully treated with additional monoclonal antibodies.</p>
