Evusheld could mean freedom for the 500,000 people still shielding in the UK. But only if the UK government procures it. This page details the testimony of overseas patients who have received Evusheld and have, as a result, got their lives back.

<h2>Diane, the blood cancer patient</h2>
<p>I’m Diane, a stage four blood cancer patient who created no antibody response to three vaccines due to my type of cancer and its treatment.</p>
<p>I’ve been able to attend medical appointments, hug loved ones, and carefully visit family I hadn’t seen in years, feeling much safer and more relaxed. Evusheld has been a game changer for many of us in the immunocompromised community who have long borne the brunt of the pandemic.</p>
<p>We hope our friends in the UK soon get the opportunity to feel more protected as the pandemic continues on and we immunocompromised remain amongst the most vulnerable.cancer and the serious hit my immune system took from chemo put me at much higher risk of death or serious illness from Covid and I was defenseless against it.</p>
<p>In fact, the only two patients I knew with this cancer, both double vaccinated, died brutally of Covid during the Delta wave, intubated and alone. Since the beginning of the pandemic I’ve shielded to safe my life, missing holidays, births, funerals, seeing my young grandchildren, and so much more. I received the gift of Evusheld on Christmas Eve, 2021. It gave me Covid-fighting antibodies in the normal range of an immunocompetent person, finally.</p>
<p>While I still live a cautious and masked life, I no longer fear dying from a disease far more insidious than my cancer.</p>

<h2>Steve, the US heart transplant recipient</h2>
<p>In my early 60s I had been quite frightened even to go to doctors appointments. Then I received Evusheld. The statistical benefit of this product and the encouragement of knowledgeable physicians in the US gave me the confidence to feel that it was much less likely for me to be seriously ill or worse if I happened to get infected. That was crucial to me. Since I received Evusheld, it has been recommended by many more physicians with at least one calling it a 'game changer' for the immunocompromised.</p>

<h2>Susan, US with graft-versus-host disease</h2>
<p>Similar to others, I was quite nervous about going out under any circumstances... complicated by the fact that I only received two doses of Pfizer due to a GVHD flare after the second. With all the positive stats and info from physicians, I now feel much more comfortable attending doctors appointments, PT, occasional shopping (with masks) etc. It has significantly changed by concerns about getting COVID-19 and the dire outcomes that could occur prior to Evusheld.</p>

<h2>Marjorie, US supporter of family member with kidney transplant</h2>
<p>My husband had a kidney transplant and had no antibodies after three vaccines and two booster shots. Evusheld has given us the opportunity to go places masked and has allowed us to have some semblance of a life. His doctor has encouraged us to be safe yet feels confident that the Evusheld has given him enough protection that, should be contract Covid, he can be successfully treated with additional monoclonal antibodies.</p>

<h2>Julie, the Addison's patient on the Evusheld trial</h2>
<p>I am 47 and have Addison's Disease, a rare autoimmune condition, alongside several other health conditions. The steroid medication I take for the Addison's makes me immunosuppressed.</p> 
<p>I joined the UK Provent trial in Jan 2021. Unfortunately, I only received the placebo in the main trial, however I was invited to join their sub-study, which is assessing the benefit of giving booster doses of Evusheld, early this year. I received my first dose of Evusheld in February and will receive a second dose in August. Having Evusheld has given me confidence to carefully get back to a 'normal' life. I have been into shops, eaten out, been to the cinema, attended a family wedding and even two music concerts! In April, my husband and daughter tested positive, yet I managed to remain covid-free!</p> 
<p>My wish is that all immunosuppressed patients in the UK can receive this prophylactic drug without further delay, </p>

<h2>Sandy, US vasculitis patient</h2>
<p>I am an extremely immune compromised individual due to the medications I take for Vasculitis, and due to Common Variable Immune Deficiency.</p> 
<p>I had 3 full Moderna vaccines and thanks to research, I know that I gained no antibodies against Covid. I remained isolated for 2+ years.</p>
<p>I was thrilled when I learned I was eligible for Evusheld. After my first dose I had gained substantial antibody protection against Covid. Four months later I still retain this.</p>
<p>Because of this protection, I feel much less stressed! My physicians have given my husband and I permission to take a River Cruise, with safety precautions. Evusheld has made this dream a reality!</p>
