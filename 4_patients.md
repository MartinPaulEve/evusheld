<h2>Still Shielding</h2>
<p>You might not realize it, given that for most people life has returned to normal, but there are over [500,000 people in the UK who still remain shielding](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/higher-risk-patients-eligible-for-covid-19-treatments-independent-advisory-group-report/defining-the-highest-risk-clinical-subgroups-upon-community-infection-with-sars-cov-2-when-considering-the-use-of-neutralising-monoclonal-antibodies). For these people, the pandemic is still the dominant factor limiting their lives. For these ultra-vulnerable people, the vaccines available to the rest of the population do not work and they remain at risk of death and serious illness. Evusheld is the answer to freeing this group, but the UK has not purchased it.<p>

<p>There are many reasons that people remain vulnerable. This page collates the stories of those patients, showing the breadth and diversity of the community who need Evusheld.</p>

<h3>Chloe: The Transplant Patient</h3>
<p><span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/chloe.jpg %}" alt="Chloe" /></span>Chloe is a 52-year-old woman who up until the year 2000 had a very normal life. She was married, working for IBM, and discussing having a family.</p>

<p>Things started to change after four miscarriages that resulted in a diagnosis of Polycythemia Rubra Vera and finally Budd Chiari syndrome.</p>

<p>In 2006 Chloe was put on the transplant list and in 2007 she received a new liver.</p>

<p>Eventually things settled down, and 3 months later Chloe returned to work. In 2010, Chloe and her husband moved to the Isle of Wight where they set up their house as a successful B&B.</p>

<p>Then, Covid struck. Chloe was instructed to ‘shield’ which meant she could no longer continue this job. Her husband, a plasterer, could no longer continue working in peoples' houses due to Chloe's condition.</p>

<p>Chloe and her husband were essentially locked up, out of work, and having to live separately.</p>

<p>They have had to sell their home and have lost virtually all the money they had, now living on savings.</p>

<p>Chloe wants to get back to work, but she cannot put her life in danger (she has been told that if she were to catch Covid there’s only a 10% chance that she would survive).</p>

<p>Evusheld could give Chloe back her life. So much of it has already been wasted that she wants to work, travel, get a house, but most of all she’d just love to be able to go to a coffee shop, or pub and enjoy a meal out.</p>

<h3>Martin: The Rheumatoid Arthritis Patient</h3>
<p><span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/martin.jpg %}" alt="Martin" />Martin in a 36-year-old university professor with rheumatoid arthritis and vasculitis. In 2016 he had a stroke due to his conditions.</p>

<p>Importantly, Martin is treated with high doses of steroids and with immunosuppressive drugs. He has had rituximab, tocilizumab, and baricitinib among others. These led to Martin developing panhypogammaglobulinemia and secondary immune deficiency. Essentially, he has no immune system.</p>

<p>Before the pandemic, Martin was used to travelling the world for speaking engagements. He would be in Tokyo one day, at Harvard the next, and then Glasgow the day after.</p>

<p>All that changed in 2020. Martin is well supported by his employer who allows him to work remotely, but he has spent two years in near total isolation, only venturing out of the house for walks with his adopted dog, Toby. Despite five vaccinations, Martin still has no antibody protection for Covid and he meets three of the criteria for those who remain exceptionally vulnerable.</p>

<p>Evusheld could free Martin. It would allow him to get back to his life and job and to have a richer ongoing existence.</p>
