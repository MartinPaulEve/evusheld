We are pleased to announce a significant step forward today, 5th July 2022. Dr. Lennard Lee of Oxford University, the co-lead for the UK Coronavirus Cancer Program and a staunch supporter of our campaign, has [launched a new initiative to garner clinical consensus on Evusheld](/assets/downloads/2022-07-05-APPG.pdf). Lord Mendelssohn and the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for CEV have commissioned the consultation to gain evidence from high-level clinicians across various disciplines, in support of Evusheld.

The APPG is a cross-party group, demonstrating that we have MPs and Lords from all sides uniting to push for Evusheld. We have been channeling information to the group to help with this push.

The consultation is targeted only at medical professionals to give an expert opinion. This will demonstrate that we have solid clinical backing. When this reaches critical momentum, it will be a potent tool for our campaign. The consultation will conclude by the end of the month and will then be presented to the government. Given the size of the consultation and the stature of the people involved, we hope the government will not be able to refute it.

We have been working with Dr. Lee and many national charities behind the scenes. They have a significant interest in getting this drug for the patients they represent and are backing the consultation. Once the consultation is complete, we will be in a position to present a unified call from our group across the patient, clinician, and political angles. This consultation can only strengthen our demand for Evusheld to the Health Minister.
