## Still Shielding
You might not realize it, given that for most people life has returned to normal, but there are over [500,000 people in the UK who still remain shielding](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/higher-risk-patients-eligible-for-covid-19-treatments-independent-advisory-group-report/defining-the-highest-risk-clinical-subgroups-upon-community-infection-with-sars-cov-2-when-considering-the-use-of-neutralising-monoclonal-antibodies). For these people, the pandemic is still the dominant factor limiting their lives. For these ultra-vulnerable people, the vaccines available to the rest of the population do not work and they remain at risk of death and serious illness. Evusheld is the answer to freeing this group, but the UK has not purchased it. 

There are many reasons that people remain vulnerable. This page will collate the stories of those patients, showing the breadth and diversity of the community who need Evusheld.
